# Course-Lab
This repository contains laboratory codes for Advanced Computing Lab.

**1. Disk Scheduling**
Contains code for three disk scheduling algorithms, namely FCFS, SCAN and LOOK.

*Note:* Performance of the algorithms depend on the seek time or the head movement of the head. Lower the head movement, faster the algorithm. Overall, LOOK algorithm provides the best performance among the three.
